## 192.168.1.100 is the IP of my physical host where
##   the kibana container is running
## you can use the internal Docker networking stack
##   but I like accessing everything from anywhere on my LAN
elasticsearch.hosts:
  - http://192.168.1.100:9200

## this tells kibana to listen for connections regardless of
##   the IP or hostname of the container
server.host: 0.0.0.0
