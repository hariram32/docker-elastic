## I use this as my hostname on test boxes
node.name: u18_docker

## with this, ES will listen on all interfaces/IPs
network.host: 0.0.0.0

## default data and log paths
path.data: /var/lib/elasticsearch
path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch

## ES has built-in ways to look for other nodes,
##   this just speeds up the startup process
cluster.initial_master_nodes:
  - u18_docker
