## the only truly necessary options
##   put logs in /var/log/logstasth
##   put queues/runtime data in /var/lib/logstash
path:
  data: /var/lib/logstash
  logs: /var/log/logstash
## logstash can do hot reloading of its config
##   directory but that's a bit further out
## this is just a stub for when I'm ready to do it
#config:
#  reload:
#    automatic: true
#    interval: 5s
